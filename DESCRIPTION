Description: This package starred as many others out there, as a large collection of functions in a source file. It became hard to look through the file and find the right function for my research towards the completion of my disseration. Functions will be described in detail in the help section, but the main theme is to automatically retrieve, filter, store, information from the NOAA data werahouse. Member functions of the pacakge automatically acquired remote data and store it in a local/remote Postgres database. Also, some member functions assume that there exist TIGER tables at the Postgres database (check the help for more details). Warning: this package is an ongoing-not-free-from-bugs-work software. Many errors from remote connections are not properly handeld yet. Another error could occur when client side requests a non-existing table or uses an invalid user name or password to access the database (all that needs handlers for cleaner returns), that's all, salu2.
